# Yugen Electron Wrapper
Cross-Platform Electron wrapper for Yugen, complete with AdBlock!
## Disclaimer
I am not affiliated with the Yugen.to development team in any way.  In no way am I benefiting from your use of this wrapper.

# How to use?
## Windows
Download the most recent win64 package from the releases tab and launch `install.exe`.  Windows defender WILL catch this file as a virus, this is because it is not trusted by Microsoft.  I can assure you, it's a false positive.
If you wish to run a portable version of this, it's really simple: navigate to the `win-unpacked` folder and execute the exe file in there.

## Linux
Download the most recent AppImage from the releases tab and launch it.  If you so desire, you can create a desktop file for easy launch, a guide can be found here: https://www.maketecheasier.com/create-desktop-file-linux/

## MacOS
There is currently no MacOS build for this, since I do not have a comptible device.  To build for MacOS, you need a mac-specific npm package.  You're welcome to compile this and do it yourself though :)

# Want to develop?
